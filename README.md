# flutter_api_with_bloc

A Flutter developer assignment.

## Getting Started

This is a Flutter developer assignment solution,
I decided to use Block Stat Management as a challenge for myself by learning something new for me and I used several flutter_bloc/webview_flutter/equatable libraries .

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
